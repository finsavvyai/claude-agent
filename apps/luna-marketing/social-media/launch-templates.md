### LinkedIn Post 2: Founder Story (Day 5)
```
Why I'm building Luna Agents 👇

3 months ago, I joined a new startup as a senior engineer.

On my first day, I asked: "How does the authentication system work?"

My manager said: "Check the docs."

There were no docs.

So I:
📂 Opened 12 GitHub repos
🔍 Read 4,800 lines of code
💬 Interrupted 3 teammates
⏱️ Spent 4.5 hours

Just to understand ONE feature.

This happened every single day.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built Luna Agents.

Now when I ask "How does authentication work?" - I get an answer in 30 seconds with exact code references.

My productivity increased 10x.
My onboarding time went from 3 weeks to 3 days.

If you're a developer tired of wasting time searching code, Luna is for you.

We launch in 25 days: https://luna-agents.dev

## 📝 REDDIT TEMPLATES

### Reddit Post 1: r/programming (Day 15 - Launch Day)

**Title**: [Launch] Luna Agents - Stop wasting 3 hours searching code. Get answers in 30 seconds.

**Body**:
```
Hey r/programming!

I spent the last 6 months building something I wish existed when I was a dev at startups.

**The Problem:**

How much time do you waste per day searching through code/docs/Slack trying to understand "how does X work?"

If you're like me, it's 2-3 hours MINIMUM. Sometimes entire days.

**What I Built:**

Luna Agents - Think ChatGPT for your codebase.

You ask questions in natural language:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the payment processing logic?"
- "What APIs does the mobile app call?"

Luna searches your entire codebase and gives you an answer in ~30 seconds with exact code references.

**10 Specialized Agents:**

Instead of one general AI, Luna has 10 agents each optimized for specific tasks:

🔍 Code Search Agent
🔒 Security Scanner (finds vulnerabilities)
✅ Test Generator (writes unit tests)
📖 Documentation Writer
🎨 UI Component Generator
🚀 Deployment Agent
📊 Analytics Agent
🐛 Debug Assistant
♻️ Refactoring Helper
🔌 API Generator

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + FastAPI (Python)
- Vector DB: Pinecone (for semantic code search)
- LLM: Claude Sonnet 4 (with custom fine-tuning)
- Infra: Cloudflare Workers (edge deployment)

**Pricing:**

- Free tier: 100 queries/month
- Pro: $29/month (unlimited)
- Open source coming Q2 2026

**Demo:**

Live demo: https://luna-agents.dev/demo

**Try it:**

Free trial (no credit card): https://app.luna-agents.dev

**Feedback Welcome:**

I'm a solo dev and would love your feedback. What features would make this useful for you?

Happy to answer any technical questions about the architecture, LLM fine-tuning, vector search implementation, etc.

**Product Hunt:**

We launched today: https://producthunt.com/products/luna-agents

If you find this useful, an upvote would mean the world 🙏

TL;DR: Built ChatGPT for your codebase. 300x faster than manual code search. Free tier available.

### Reddit Post 2: r/SideProject (Day 16)

**Title**: Built Luna Agents in 6 months while working full-time. Here's what I learned.

**Body**:
```
**The Project:**

Luna Agents - AI-powered code search that saves developers 20 hours/week.

**Stats (24 hours after launch):**

- 2,347 signups
- 73 paying customers ($2,117 MRR)
- #3 on Product Hunt
- Built entirely solo (nights + weekends)

✅ Solving my own problem (authenticity resonated)
✅ Free tier (80% of signups start free, 12% convert)
✅ Clear ROI messaging (6,900% ROI = easy sell)

**What Didn't Work:**

❌ Paid ads (burned $3K, got 12 signups)
❌ Cold outreach (0.2% response rate)
❌ Perfectionism (shipped v1 with bugs, fixed fast)

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Python
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- LLM: Claude Sonnet
- Hosting: Cloudflare Workers
- Payments: LemonSqueezy

**Costs:**

- Open source core search

**Lessons:**

1. Ship fast, iterate faster
2. Talk to users daily
3. ROI > Features in messaging
4. Free tier = growth engine
5. Build in public = built-in marketing

## 📰 DEV.TO / HASHNODE TEMPLATES

### Blog Post 1: Technical Deep Dive (Day 10)

**Title**: How I Built Semantic Code Search with Claude AI and Vector Embeddings

**Body**:
```markdown
# How I Built Semantic Code Search with Claude AI and Vector Embeddings

## The Problem

Traditional code search (like GitHub search or grep) only finds exact keyword matches.

But developers don't think in keywords. They think in concepts:

- "Where is the authentication logic?" (not searching for "auth" string)
- "How do we handle payments?" (not searching for "stripe")
- "What APIs does the mobile app call?" (semantic understanding needed)

I built Luna Agents to solve this with semantic code search.

## Architecture Overview

```
User Query → Embedding Model → Vector Search → Claude AI → Formatted Answer
```

## Step 1: Code Ingestion

When you connect a GitHub repo, we:

1. Clone the repo
2. Parse all files (ignore node_modules, .git, etc.)
3. Split into chunks (max 1000 tokens per chunk)
4. Generate embeddings using `text-embedding-ada-002`
5. Store in Pinecone vector DB

**Code snippet:**
```javascript
async function ingestRepository(repoUrl) {
  const files = await cloneAndParse(repoUrl);

  for (const file of files) {
    const chunks = splitIntoChunks(file.content, 1000);

    for (const chunk of chunks) {
      const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
        model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
        input: chunk.text
      });

      await pinecone.upsert({
        id: `${file.path}:${chunk.id}`,
        values: embedding.data[0].embedding,
        metadata: {
          filepath: file.path,
          language: file.language,
          chunk_text: chunk.text,
          line_start: chunk.lineStart,
          line_end: chunk.lineEnd
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Semantic Search

When user asks a question:

1. Convert query to embedding
2. Vector search in Pinecone (cosine similarity)
3. Return top 10 most relevant code chunks

**Code snippet:**
```javascript
async function semanticSearch(query, repoId) {
  // Convert query to embedding
  const queryEmbedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
    input: query
  });

  // Search Pinecone
  const results = await pinecone.query({
    vector: queryEmbedding.data[0].embedding,
    topK: 10,
    filter: { repo_id: repoId },
    includeMetadata: true
  });

  return results.matches.map(match => ({
    filepath: match.metadata.filepath,
    code: match.metadata.chunk_text,
    lines: `${match.metadata.line_start}-${match.metadata.line_end}`,
    similarity: match.score
  }));
}
```

## Step 3: Claude AI Synthesis

Take the 10 code chunks and send to Claude with:

```javascript
const prompt = `
You are a code search assistant.

User Question: ${query}

Relevant Code Chunks:
${chunks.map(c => `
File: ${c.filepath} (lines ${c.lines})
\`\`\`${c.language}
${c.code}
\`\`\`
`).join('\n')}

Provide a concise answer with:
1. Direct answer to the question
2. File paths where relevant code lives
3. Code snippets (with line numbers)
4. Brief explanation of how it works
`;

const answer = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
});
```

## Results

**Before (grep/GitHub search):**
- Query: "authentication logic"
- Results: 847 files with word "auth"
- Time to find answer: 2.5 hours

**After (Luna semantic search):**
- Query: "How does user authentication work?"
- Results: Exact file with auth implementation
- Time to answer: 30 seconds

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Cache embeddings for 7 days
2. **Batch processing**: Generate embeddings in batches of 100
3. **Lazy loading**: Only embed files when repo is queried
4. **Incremental updates**: Only re-embed changed files on git push

## Cost Analysis

- Embedding cost: ~$0.02 per 10K lines of code
- Vector storage: $0.10/GB/month (Pinecone)
- Claude API: $0.003 per query

For a 100K line codebase:
- One-time ingestion: $0.20
- Monthly storage: $0.05
- 1,000 queries/month: $3.00

**Total: ~$3.25/month for unlimited searches**
