### First Comment (Post IMMEDIATELY after launch)

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Shahar, founder of Luna Agents.

**Why I built this:**

6 months ago, I joined a new startup as a senior engineer.

On Day 1, I asked my manager: "How does the authentication system work?"

He said: "Check the docs."

There were no docs.

So I:
📂 Opened 12 GitHub repos
🔍 Read 4,800 lines of code
💬 Interrupted 3 teammates
⏱️ Wasted 4.5 hours

Just to understand ONE feature.

This happened EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built Luna.

---

**What is Luna Agents?**

Think **Google + ChatGPT for your codebase**.

Instead of spending 2.5 hours searching, you ask Luna a question in natural language:

✅ "How does authentication work?"
✅ "Where is the payment processing logic?"
✅ "What APIs does the mobile app call?"
✅ "Find all security vulnerabilities"

Luna searches your entire codebase and answers in ~30 seconds with exact file references + code snippets.

---

**10 Specialized AI Agents:**

🔍 **Code Search** - Find anything instantly with semantic search
🔒 **Security Scanner** - Detect vulnerabilities automatically
✅ **Test Generator** - Write unit tests with one click
📖 **Doc Writer** - Generate comprehensive documentation
🚀 **Deploy Agent** - One-click deployment to production
🎨 **UI Generator** - Build React components from descriptions
📊 **Analytics** - Track code metrics & health
🐛 **Debug Assistant** - Fix bugs 10x faster
♻️ **Refactor Helper** - Clean code automatically
🔌 **API Generator** - Build REST APIs from specs

Each agent is fine-tuned for its specific task. No more generic AI - you get experts.

---
