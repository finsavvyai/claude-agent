## 📧 TWITTER DM TEMPLATES

### Template 1: For Developer Influencers

**When to send**: After they tweet about dev tools, productivity, or code search

```
Hey {{NAME}}! 👋

Saw your tweet about {{TOPIC}} - totally relate.

Quick Q: How much time do you spend per day searching through code/docs trying to understand "how does X work?"

I built something that might save you 10-20 hours/week. It's called Luna Agents - basically Google + ChatGPT for your codebase.

Ask it questions like:
• "How does authentication work?"
• "Where is the payment logic?"
• "What APIs does the mobile app call?"

Get answers in 30 seconds instead of 2.5 hours.

Would you be down to try the beta? You'd get:
✨ Free Pro for life ($348/year value)
✨ Direct line to me for support
✨ Early access to all new features

No pressure! Just thought it might be useful given what you're building.

— Shahar

P.S. We're launching on Product Hunt in 2 weeks. If you dig it, would mean the world to get your support 🙏
```

### Template 2: For Developer Influencers (Alternative - Shorter)

```
{{NAME}} - love your content on {{TOPIC}}!

Built something I think you'd find useful: Luna Agents.

It's ChatGPT for your codebase. Ask questions, get instant answers with code references.

Would you try the beta? Free Pro for life if you give feedback.

Demo: [2-min video link]

Interested?

Hey {{NAME}},

Totally understand if you're swamped!

Just wanted to share this quick demo since I think you'd appreciate the tech:

[Link to 2-min demo video]

Luna cuts code search time from 2.5 hours → 30 seconds using vector embeddings + Claude AI.

## 💼 LINKEDIN DM TEMPLATES

### Template 1: For CTOs/Engineering Managers

**Subject**: Thought this might help {{COMPANY}}'s team

```
Hi {{NAME}},

Saw that you're {{TITLE}} at {{COMPANY}} - congrats on the {{RECENT_NEWS}}!

I'm building something that might help your team: Luna Agents.

**The Problem:**
New engineers at fast-growing companies waste 2-3 weeks onboarding because they spend hours searching through code/docs trying to understand "how does X work?"

**The Solution:**
Luna lets them ask questions in natural language and get instant answers with exact code references.

Example:
Q: "How does our authentication work?"
A: [30-second answer with file paths + code snippets]

**Results we're seeing:**
• 80% reduction in onboarding time (3 weeks → 3 days)
• 40% increase in team productivity
• $48K/month savings for 50-person eng team

**Would you be open to a 15-min demo?**

I can show you:
1. Live demo on a sample codebase
2. ROI calculator specific to your team size
3. Beta pricing (50% off first year)

How about {{TUESDAY}} or {{THURSDAY}} at {{TIME}}?

Best,
Shahar Solomon
Founder, Luna Agents
https://luna-agents.dev
```

### Template 2: For CTOs (Shorter - Pain Point Focus)

**Subject**: Quick question about {{COMPANY}}'s onboarding

```
{{NAME}},

Quick question: How long does it typically take for a new engineer at {{COMPANY}} to become productive?

I'm working on a tool that cuts onboarding time by 80% (3 weeks → 3 days) by giving developers instant answers to "how does X work?" instead of making them search for hours.

It's called Luna Agents - think ChatGPT for your codebase.

Would you be interested in trying the beta with your team?

Beta users get:
• 50% off first year
• Free Pro for 3 months
• White-glove onboarding

Takes 5 minutes to set up, works with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

Open to a quick call?

— Shahar
```

### Template 3: For VPs of Engineering

**Subject**: {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} recommended I reach out

```
Hi {{NAME}},

{{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} mentioned you're always looking for ways to improve developer productivity at {{COMPANY}}.

I built Luna Agents - an AI tool that our beta customers are using to save 20 hours per developer per week.

**How it works:**
Instead of spending 2.5 hours searching code/docs/Slack, developers ask Luna questions and get instant answers.

**Use cases:**
• New hire onboarding (3 weeks → 3 days)
• Understanding legacy code
• Cross-team collaboration
• Documentation generation

**ROI for a 20-person team:**
• Time saved: 400 hours/week
• Cost savings: $34K/month
• Luna cost: $1,980/month
• Net ROI: 1,617%

**Demo?**

I can show you how it works in 10 minutes.

Available {{DAY}} or {{DAY}} this week?

Best,
Shahar

## 🔥 REDDIT COMMENT TEMPLATES

### For r/programming, r/webdev, r/javascript

**When someone posts**: "How do you search through large codebases?"

**Comment**:
```
I literally built a tool for this exact problem.

It's called Luna Agents - basically ChatGPT for your codebase.

Instead of grepping for keywords or using GitHub search (which only finds exact matches), you ask questions in natural language:

- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the payment processing logic?"
- "What APIs does the mobile app call?"

It uses vector embeddings to do semantic search + Claude AI to synthesize the answer.

Example:
Query: "How does our auth work?"
Time: 30 seconds
Result: Detailed answer with file paths + code snippets

vs.

Manual search: 2.5 hours of reading code

Free tier available: https://luna-agents.dev

Happy to answer any technical questions about how it works (vector DB, LLM fine-tuning, etc.)
```

### For r/SideProject, r/startups

**When someone posts**: "Show off your side project"

**Comment**:
```
Built Luna Agents over the past 6 months (nights + weekends).

**What it does:**
AI-powered code search that answers questions about your codebase in natural language.

**Problem it solves:**
Developers waste 40% of their day searching code/docs. Luna cuts search time from 2.5 hours → 30 seconds.

**Stats so far:**
- 50 beta users
- 12 paying customers ($348 MRR)
- Launching on Product Hunt next week

**Tech stack:**
React + Node.js + Claude AI + Pinecone vector DB + Cloudflare Workers

**Try it:**
https://luna-agents.dev (free tier, no CC)

**Feedback welcome!**
What features would make this useful for you?
